## General Information
Creating a program of farm simulation role-playing game with the background story of a programmer who is forced to do farming, fishing, and ranching, in order to pay his debts. The program was written in a declarative programming language, namely Prolog. To run and play the game, you need GNU Prolog to be used as the terminal base.


## How to Run
- Make sure to have [GNU Prolog Console](http://www.gprolog.org/) used to run the program.
- Make sure that the console is in the directory of the main program.
- Use `change_directory(address).` to change the directory the console in, or from the menu 'File' of GNU Prolog Console, choose 'Change Directory' and navigate to the folder.
- Run the program 'main.pl' by entering `consult('main').` or choose the file directly from the 'Consult' Menu in GNU Prolog Console.
- Enter the commands available to player in the program. This can be checked by navigating to the WikiLog in the game.
