## Setup
- Make sure to have [GNU Prolog Console](http://www.gprolog.org/) used to run the program.
- Make sure that the console is in the directory of the main program.
- Use `change_directory(address).` to change the directory the console in, or from the menu 'File' of GNU Prolog Console, choose 'Change Directory' and navigate to the folder.
- Run the program 'main.pl' by entering `consult('main').` or choose the file directly from the 'Consult' Menu in GNU Prolog Console.
- Enter the commands available to player in the program. This can be checked by navigating to the WikiLog in the game.
